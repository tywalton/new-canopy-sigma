# Canopy Template

This repository offers a trimmed down starting point for new Canopy IIIF projects. When you need deeper documentation, examples, or release notes, vist the main project at https://canopy-iiif.github.io/app/.

## Getting Started

Walk through the [Quick Start guide](https://canopy-iiif.github.io/app/docs/user-guides/canopy-get-started.html) to stand up your new digital project, configure `canopy.yml` using IIIF collections and manifests, and add pages and layouts under `content/`.

## Updates

Keep your project current by running `npm install @canopy-iiif/app@latest @samvera/clover-iiif@latest` whenever a new release ships, or trigger the _Update Canopy App_ GitHub action (Actions tab → _Update Canopy App_ → _Run workflow_) and let it open a pull request that bumps both dependencies for you. Read the [Developer documentation](https://canopy-iiif.github.io/app/docs/developers) for more information.

## Contributing

All development happens in https://github.com/canopy-iiif/app. If you are interested in shaping Canopy IIIF, please open an issue, share feedback, or send a pull request.
